## 🌿 A Bit More About Me

Great engineering isn’t about knowing everything — it’s about staying curious, asking thoughtful questions, and building things that work well for real teams. I care about clean code, practical design, and long-term maintainability.

I enjoy mentoring others, streamlining cloud workflows, and building tools that help teams move faster and with more confidence. Whether creating reusable Terraform modules or scaling enterprise platforms, I aim to make things more understandable and sustainable.

Outside of work, you'll usually find me on a trail, practicing yoga, playing bass, or digging into a good book. Progress — in tech and in life — often comes through iteration, humility, and not taking ourselves too seriously. 🌱
